# Spaces are interpreted as data separators, meaning they are followed by a new object of data.
# Parantheses can be wrapped around character arrays to indicate contained spaces are part of the character array itself.
# Labels indicate the type of information that follows. They are identified by the succeeding colon and can contain any character except spaces.
