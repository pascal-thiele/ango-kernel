The device interface table is excluded from following calculations, since it depends on the content of the systems device tree.

206 040, hardware thread table
32 768, user table
74 752, process table
12 288, memory table
446 464, thread table
20 480, scheduler table

The total initial memory usage, excluding device interface table and program code:
792 792 bytes

Concluding, the minimum amount of kernel memory is four mebibytes.
hexadecimal, 40 0000
